### Intro
Ok, so we are going to make rock-paper-scissors using JavaScript! Hooray! Making this game is a great exercise in declaring variables, debugging, and seeing how your JavaScript code will run. Feel free to give it a shot on your own before reading the tutorial. I will go over how to run your code using Chrome in the next section.

### Chrome Dev-Tools and You!
